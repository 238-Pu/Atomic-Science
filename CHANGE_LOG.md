# INFO
This log contains changes made to the project. Each entry contains changed made after the last version but before the number was changed. Any changes made after a number change are considered part of the next release. This is regardless if versions are still being released with that version number attached. 

If this is a problem, use exact build numbers to track changes. As each build logs the git-hash it was created from to better understand changes made.

## 3.0.1
### Changes
Full rewrite not based on the code from 1.6.4, 1.5.2, or Resonant Induction versions

Following is a list of content created for the version. As this is an initial release of the rewrite. Which does not include all content as the focus was on a minimum viable product.

New:
    thermal system -> stores heat values
    thermal mechanics -> spreads heat via a thread
    radioactive material map -> stores radioactive material values
    radiation map -> stores radiation values
    radiation mechanics -> calculates radiation from sources
    radiation damage -> harms entities from radiation
    
    Waste recovery mechanics -> all processing machines generate waste
    
    Contaminated Mineral Solution -> Byproduct of ore processing
    Contaminated Mineral Water -> Byproduct of hexafluoride processing
    Contaminated Water -> Byproduct of processing waste and output of reactor
    Reactor Waste -> Replaces toxic waste from old mod. Also output of reactor
    
    Toxic Mineral Waste -> byproduct of reducing toxic fluids into a solid. Contains some minerals as dust and can be refined into dust
    Toxic Waste -> byproduct of reducing toxic fluids into a solid
    
    Dust loot table -> used in the extractor for for Toxic Mineral Waste processing.
    
    Recipe objects -> all processing machines support adding new recipes
    
    Configs -> mod is heavily customizable with most options being exposed.

Recreated:
    Protective armor
    Fission reactor core
    Extractor + recipes
    Boiler + recipes
    Centrifuge + recipes
    Fuel rod
    Breeder Rod
    U235 Pellet
    U238 Pellet
    Heat probe
    Fluid Cells
    Yellocake
    Uranium Ore
    Turbines
    Steam Funnel
    
Removed:
    Old heat system -> used too much CPU
    Old events -> used too much CPU    
    Potion effects -> didn't allow for good gameplay and potion IDs are limited
    Reactor explosion -> will be replaced by a meltdown event and hydrogen explosions 
    Dependency on large lib -> mod is standalone to improve user experience
    Localizations -> part of rewrite, can't tell if they are valid
    
Old content:
    All models and textures are from the old mod.
    Models have been updated as .obj from .techne
    A few textures have been fixed
    Some textures have been added
    
Changes:
    No old code is being used beyond a few interfaces from VoltzEngine (previously ResonantEngine which the mod used)
    
    All processing recipes produce waste
    
    Heat is no longer actively released from reactor. Being replace with a more static system that calculated heat, spreads, and then cached heat to reduce CPU usage.
    
    Radiation is no longer a potion effect. It is now handled via its own system.
    
    Radioactive blocks are no longer used. Radioactive material can now be applied to all blocks, items, and entities.
    
    Steam is no longer generated by events. Instead it is calculated based on thermal system.
    
    Turbines and steam funnel no longer use events to get steam. Values are calculated and cached based on map data.
    
    Fluid cells are no longer simple items. Any cell that used a fluid is now a fluid container. This allows any fluid to be stored.
    
    Dark-matter was replaced with strange matter. This was the original name of the item and matched better with current science understanding.
    
    Antimatter & Strange matter are now fluids. Both can be stored but are limited to powered fluid cells.
    
    Turbines will create a new tile per power system. This is to reduce complexity required to support several power systems on a single class.
